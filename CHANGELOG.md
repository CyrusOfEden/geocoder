[Unreleased]

[2.0.0]

** BREAKING**

This version will break how the geocoder starts. While we have kept the API similar and proposed a forward change, you will still need to add geocoder to your application tree. See changes below on how to migrate.

### Changes

- Rearchitected per the the [Elixir recommendation](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/library-guidelines.html#avoid-spawning-unsupervised-processes) as well as [Chris Keathley](https://keathley.io/blog/reusable-libraries.html). No more an application is started. Instead a `Geocoder.Supervisor` was created to supervise the necessary processes. Also all configurations are now removed from the :geocoder application. Instead it is all specified in the supervisor allowing for more flexibility and to even start multiple pools
- Added support for configurable http client. Currently implemented out of the box HTTPoison and Hackney. Defaults to HTTPoison.
- Added support for configurable JSON codec. Currently implemented out of the box Json and JSX. Defaults to Jason.
- Support multiple parallel supervisor (so you can potentially use multiple provider, each with their own pool)
- Consolidated configuration to not use Application.get_env
- Improved documentation in general
- Cleanup code and configured Credo to improve maintenance

### Migrating from 1.x versions

1. add to your supervising tree the geocoder supervisor
2. Convert your configuration to the new format (the one you had under `config :geocoder, ...`)
3. Remove all the `config :geocoder, ...` from your config/*

that's it! should just work out of the box as we will default the processes name for you to be compatible.
